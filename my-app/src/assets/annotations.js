  "The paper already has a pre-set argument and uses the data to support this argument. instead, there should be a question (e.g. does body camera affect officer conviction probability?) and the data should affirm or nullify this question.",
  "What does 'research' have to look like in order to hold weight, voice, and power? And why? There are so many articles and activists speaking on how body cameras do not lead to increased accountability (see links), but in what contexts/conversations is formalized research necessary in order to be heard? How do pre-held ideas of research having more authority or truth potentially privilege one form of knowledge over another? Or lend an air of unquestionable authority to an argument? Here, we are inviting you into the process of questioning data-driven research–and unpacking the ways it is a powerful tool that should be demystified and used to empower rather disempower. Data is a tool used to support everything from policy to magazine articles. But, like all tools we must look at the power structures it's used within, who it benefits, and who has access to the conversations it speaks within. (see links)",
  "The body camera data itself does not depict how footage contributes to the accountability process, it simply shows correlations between whether body cameras were used and whether officers were charged.",
"The use (or lack thereof) of body cameras is a major obstacle to transparency and accountability, as some jurisdictions are lenient on when body cameras can be turned off, if/when/how the footage is released to the public. For example, NY state requires the public to file an open-records request which takes months to process. Furthermore, police departments are the ones that manage body camera data and can easily tamper with or destroy footage.",
"Stating a dataset is comprehensive and widely crowdsourced is a vague way of depicting the completeness of the dataset. After further analyzing the dataset, we see there are 2996 null values for body camera information out of 8507 rows total.",
"Crowdsourced data often still relies on police databases and police generated information as one of its sources. Furthermore, these datasets may have skeptical sources of funding, as we saw in KilledByPolice.net. Just because a dataset is crowdsourced, doesn't mean it is more objective or impartial.",
"This statement shows signs of math-washing. Mathwashing: the idea that math (data and algorithms too) are neutral, unbiased, and more objective/truer forms of information. (see links)",
"One of the primary sources of this database is KilledByPolice.net. Upon doing research into this source, we have found that the site is affiliated with Amazon advertising, openly advertises guns, and makes references such as 'shooting buddies'. All of this evidence can lead us to question the objectivity of KilledByPolice.net as a source.",
"How is this statistic confirmed? Through which sources?",
"Completeness is a big claim to make: what about underdocumented and underreported crimes. Underdocumented crimes being crimes that are not documented within the data, perhaps because of biased police officer dismissal when the report was made, mishaps in the paperwork, etc. Underdocumented crimes are crimes that are not reported, often because of the traumatic history marginalized communities, speciically Black and Brown, have with the police force. This possibly missing data is swept under the rug with a claim of completeness and totality, and removes the need for more in depth understanding and questioning. And in fact, upon further investigation, the majority of cases are 'pending investigation' which raises the question, how often are case data updated? How is completeness maintained as time moves on and the record changes?",
"This study is equating criminal charges to accountability–the fields in the database offer no other alternative information. This then assumes that charging an officer is equated to 'accountability' without considering other possibilities of justice like defunding, divestment, and reparations. We need to question what the scope of accountability truly is and how carceral state ideas of justice are then being built into the databases and data collected. What does accountability look like to the loved ones or communities affected by loss of life?",
"Are these categories perceived of self-reported? Especially when it comes to categories like mental health and gender, self-reporting is so crucial to identify the person in the way they want to be seen/see themselves. Because most of this data is compiled from police data, which is police-reported, it can be assumed that these categories are perceived mental health, perceived race, and perceived gender. However, the lack of specification recenters the police officer's perception as the truth about the victim's identity. What channels are there for people and their loved ones to write/right the record, in this database and the ones it drew from?",
"This visualization is shown as a bar graph along with statistical data. We can see how removing the statistical data and only displaying the bar graph of percentages displays a very different picture of body camera footage and its effect on charges. Different visualization strategies can change the way data is understood and perceived.",
"What factors like ongoing activism and community organizing work might also be leading to higher conviction rates in the last few years? How does this dismiss The jump to saying 'this directly relates' can be really misleading. Especially when there's a difference between correlation (two variables, or factors, seem to have a relatioship with one another) and causation (one variable/factor directly causes changes in the other). In reality, causation is very hard to show without a controlled set up and trial, and in uncontrolled reality (which this data is collected from), there are too many variables to be able to show direct causation.
