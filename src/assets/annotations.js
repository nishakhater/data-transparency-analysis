  "The paper already has a pre-set argument and uses the data to support this argument. instead, there should be a question (e.g. does body camera affect officer conviction probability?) and the data should affirm or nullify this question.",
  "What does 'research' have to look like in order to hold weight, voice, and power? And why? There are so many articles and activists speaking on how body cameras do not lead to increased accountability but do significantly increase police department budgets and funding (see links), but what contexts/conversations is formalized research necessary in order to be heard? How do pre-held ideas of research having more authority or truth potentially privilege one form of knowledge over another? Or lend an air of unquestionable authority to an argument? Here, we are inviting you into the process of questioning data-driven research–and unpacking the ways it is a powerful tool that should be demystified and used to empower rather disempower. Data is a tool used to support everything from policy to magazine articles. But, like all tools we must look at the power structures it's used within, who it benefits, and who has access to the conversations it speaks within. (see links)",
  "The body camera data itself does not depict how footage contributes to the accountability process, it simply shows correlations between whether body cameras were used and whether officers were charged.",
  "The use (or lack thereof) of body cameras is a major obstacle to transparency and accountability, as some jurisdictions are lenient on when body cameras can be turned off, if/when/how the footage is released to the public. For example, NY state requires the public to file an open-records request which takes months to process. Furthermore, police departments are the ones that manage body camera data and can easily tamper with or destroy footage.",
  "Stating a dataset is comprehensive and widely crowdsourced is a vague way of depicting the completeness of the dataset. After further analyzing the dataset, we see there are 2996 null values for body camera information out of 8507 rows total.",
  "Crowdsourced data often still relies on police databases and police generated information as one of its sources. Furthermore, these datasets may have skeptical sources of funding, as we saw in KilledByPolice.net. Just because a dataset is crowdsourced, doesn't mean it is more objective or impartial.",
  "This statement shows signs of math-washing. Mathwashing: the idea that math (data and algorithms too) are neutral, unbiased, and more objective/truer forms of information. (see links)",
 //section 2
  "One of the primary sources of this database is KilledByPolice.net. Upon doing research into this source, we have found that the site is affiliated with Amazon advertising, openly advertises guns, and makes references such as 'shooting buddies'. All of this evidence can lead us to question the objectivity of KilledByPolice.net as a source.",
  "How is this statistic confirmed? Through which sources?",
  "Completeness is a big claim to make: what about underdocumented and underreported crimes. Underdocumented crimes being crimes that are not documented within the data, perhaps because of biased police officer dismissal when the report was made, mishaps in the paperwork, etc. Underdocumented crimes are crimes that are not reported, often because of the traumatic history marginalized communities, speciically Black and Brown, have with the police force. This possibly missing data is swept under the rug with a claim of completeness and totality, and removes the need for more in depth understanding and questioning. And in fact, upon further investigation, the majority of cases are 'pending investigation' which raises the question, how often are case data updated? How is completeness maintained as time moves on and the record changes?",
  "This study is equating criminal charges to accountability–the fields in the database offer no other alternative information. This then assumes that charging an officer is equated to 'accountability' without considering other possibilities of justice like defunding, divestment, and reparations. We need to question what the scope of accountability truly is and how carceral state ideas of justice are then being built into the databases and data collected. What does accountability look like to the loved ones or communities affected by loss of life?",
  "Are these categories perceived of self-reported? Especially when it comes to categories like mental health and gender, self-reporting is so crucial to identify the person in the way they want to be seen/see themselves. Because most of this data is compiled from police data, which is police-reported, it can be assumed that these categories are perceived mental health, perceived race, and perceived gender. However, the lack of specification recenters the police officer's perception as the truth about the victim's identity. What channels are there for people and their loved ones to write/right the record, in this database and the ones it drew from?",
  "This visualization is shown as a bar graph along with statistical data. We can see how removing the statistical data and only displaying the bar graph of percentages displays a very different picture of body camera footage and its effect on charges. Different visualization strategies can change the way data is understood and perceived.",

  "What factors like ongoing activism and community organizing work might also be leading to higher conviction rates in the last few years? The jump to saying 'this directly relates' can be really misleading. Especially when there's a difference between correlation (two variables, or factors, seem to have a relatioship with one another) and causation (one variable/factor directly causes changes in the other). In reality, causation is very hard to show without a controlled set up and trial, and in uncontrolled reality (which this data is collected from), there are too many variables to be able to show direct causation. ",
  "What questions are being answered through this data? This appears to be an application of Bayes' Theorem, but the conditional probabilities don't actually tell us much about the effectiveness of body cameras. A similar misstep occurred by a group performing a study on racial disparities in police violence and was reported on by the Washington Post: The group 'analyzed how often fatally shot civilians were black and Hispanic. But they confused this with a much more important question: How often are black and Hispanic civilians fatally shot.'",
  "Body cameras have not been normalized until recently, and many police departments may not have the funding to purchase them. These are a few of the many reasons the number of police officers not wearing body cameras is so much higher than the number of officers wearing them. Essentially, without context, this piece of data alone is not effective in making a case for body camera usage.",
  "A study has shown that in 92.6% of national cases involving body cameras, the footage has been used against private citizens. Only in 8.3% of the cases has body camera footage been used to prosecute police officers.",
  "'Officers can get quick access to most videos, which gives them the ability to build a one-sided public-relations narrative, while victims of misconduct are left with only their own accounts as evidence. In other words, the NYPD policy further stacks the deck against victims.'",
  "Body cameras were initially implemented to help police resolve citizen complaints more efficiently. As mentioned earlier, more than in 90% of cases in which body camera footage is used, it is used against private citizens.",
  "There is policy currently increasing surveillance by law enforcement... what do we risk by trusting (assuming) that policy adjustments will prevent rather than just further augment this surveillance? (see link)",
  "Crime Center Software produces the software for body cameras, a key motive for biased recommendations driven by potential profit.",
  "This controlled study (see link) actually shows how the difference in behavior between the officers who knew they were being watched and the officers who knew they were not was statistically insignificant.",
  "As stated earlier, a large majority of cases using body camera footage have actually used the footage against private citizens.",
  "Although this dataset is more completed, it is still controlled/owned/skewed by those who hold it. There is also a danger of not only data privileging but video privileging too (the idea that video is the truth and can't be skewed–see link).",
  "The key problem here is that the police departments are the ones doing the verifying and reviewing of the recording, which can lead to tampering and hiding body cam data that is sensitive.",
  "As questioned earlier, the categorization of mental health needs to be called into question. The data entries sometimes list 'Alcohol use' under mental health, further calling into question the validity of this category and what its data can really tell us",
  "Body cameras do not necessarily aid the identification process, as it is still the police officers who are reporting these characteristics and thus they are still 'perceived'.",
  //
  "How much of this data is unknown/unspecified? These pie charts do not account for holes and null values in the data. And how can you draw conclusions without knowing what is not seen? What is hidden? What, then, are the limits of data visualization in showing what's missing?",
  "For reasons mentioned earlier (biased sources, skeptical funding, police database sources), publicly available data is not as ideal, objective or accurate as it is perceived to be.",
  "Correlation does not entail direct causation.",
  "Incomplete transparency tells partial stories. For example, even in this paper, we've seen how the data is incomplete and flawed for many reasons–so the story it tells about body cameras and criminal charges (much less justice) is incomplete and partial. However, as we've also seen in this paper, impartial and flawed data can still be used (and too often is) to support specific policies and reform efforts. Transparency, like 'objectivity', is a term that can claim a lot of truth without context. As seen in (linked) article, bodycam footage can be used just as easily to protect officers with bolstered “reasonable fear” defense claims–backed by the 1989 Supreme Court Decision that “objectively reasonable” justifies the use of deadly force.",
  "As stated earlier, body camera data can be inconsistent due to police officers turning the cameras off, data being tampered with or destroyed, etc.",
  "Video footage can also be skewed to incorrectly depict a situation, especially with the way defense lawyers can play the video at normal or faster speed to bolster `reasonable fear` claims under the 1989 Supreme Court ruling of 'objectively reasonable' use of deadly force. What is transparency without power? What is data without power?",
  "Data has a lot of power, importance, and potential–and there have already been some amazing instances of data speaking to power (see link) – especially in power regulation/policy creation and creating space for counter-surveillance. But the way the data is collected, stored, and visualized/understood, and by who and for what, needs to be constantly interrogated."
